# greenhouse-monitoring
The main aim of this project is monitor the in-house environment status and accordingly the owner can take appropriate measures to provide the plants a suitable environment.  A single unit of the greenhouse structure prototype has been constructed and integrated with the sensors. The control system is designed with PIC microcontroller (PIC18F2550) in simulation environment while for the hardware Arduino is used. This project is based on simulating the environment of a greenhouse and displaying the whole model on the hardware with parameters like light intensity, humidity, temperature and soil moisture, being monitored using sensors.
